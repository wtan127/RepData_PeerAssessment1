## Loading and preprocessing the data
data <- read.csv("activity.csv")
data$date <- as.Date(data$date, "%Y-%m-%d")
data2 <- data[complete.cases(data),]
#install.packages("dplyr")
library(dplyr)

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
aggregate(data2$steps, list(data2$date), mean)  #lists steps by day
par(mfrow=c(1,1))
hist(data2$steps)
mean(data2$steps)  #37.3826
median(data2$steps)  #0

## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values
hasdata <- complete.cases(data)
sum(!hasdata)  #2304

## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
